# Asgard

The Asgard project itself will NOT build any of honest-to-goodness tools. It just compresses some great development tools or configuration as well as a small setup script into a self-extractable archive by [Stephane Peter's makeself](https://github.com/megastep/makeself). By this way, you will get a self-contained installer which is still working off-line.
